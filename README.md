## Concept behind cobogo

Cobogó is an element of Brazilian architecture. It is a little block of concrete that allows light and fresh air to come inside rooms, they can have infinite different styles and colors which can always be combined to form new unique style.

All these characteristics can be associated with what we want to achieve with this dApp. The blocks allude to both blockchain and composability (which are usually compared to Lego blocks), the light entering the room represents the videos being watched in the house of each fan and the air represents the new ways that the Dev Protocol ecosystem allows creators to monetize themselves, allowing new types of Creators to rise and be successful. 

# The next generation of YouTube monetization
cobogo is a protocol that has the goal of funding Content Creators sustainably through their own communities. It is a dApp that leverages Web 3.0 to monetize Creators while maximizing their growth and community building abilities. We will leverage this to bring as many creators as possible to our platform and transform it into the first Content Creator DAO.
It works by allowing Creators to mint their own Social Tokens and Staking Pool, where Patrons can stake on it. After that, both Creators and Patrons get rewards in the form of a yield, in a 50%/50% split.
All Creators have to do after minting their pool is let their community know about this opportunity, and how it is a win-win situation. They can also offer Perks to those staking from them, which can vary from receiving the Creator’s Social Tokens, getting access to a private discord, private content and even being able to vote for the next videos' type of content. The possibilities are endless.
We intend to keep growing, introducing more monetization methods and finding new ways to give rewards and benefits for Creators and Patrons. 

## Funding Mechanism

We have designed an unique funding mechanism that allows fans to support their favorite Content Creators sustainably.
Based on DeFi, our platform works by having the Content Creator mint their own Staking Pool, where their fans and community can stake CBG tokens in. After that, both Creators and Fans get rewarded in the form of a yield, in a 50%/50% split.
In sum, fans will be able to buy CBG tokens, stake those tokens in their favorite Content Creator's pool, and then earn the rewards on a block (minute) basis, based on the current APY (Annual Percentage Yield).
These tokens will not be locked for any period of time, which means the fan will be able to withdraw them anytime they want, as well as the rewards accrued.
This way, Content Creators can monetize their work without having to rely on a single point of failure, and Fans can support Creators while still keeping their principal, and earning interest on top of it.
